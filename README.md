Commander
=========
Commander is a daemon that updates the the ZSH command line prompt in real time.  It will build the command line based on a simple configuration.  This should hopefully be drastically faster than parsing this information via bash/zsh.  Additionally, it can update the values outside of hitting enter.  This is useful for keeping the time, date, and battery levels updated consistently.  Currently it is designed for ZSH, but I may expand it for other shells in the future.
